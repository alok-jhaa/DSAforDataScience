## oops_python.ipynb

This Jupyter notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, with explanations, analogies, and practical code examples.

### Topics Covered

- **Classes and Objects**
  - What is a class?
  - How to create objects (instances)
  - Example: Parrot class and objects

- **Constructors**
  - Purpose of `__init__`
  - Initializing object attributes
  - Example: Human and Car classes

- **Variable Types**
  - Local vs Global variables
  - Using the `global` keyword

- **Types of Methods**
  - Instance Methods
  - Class Methods (`@classmethod`)
  - Static Methods (`@staticmethod`)
  - Analogies for each method type

- **Quiz Section**
  - Practice questions on instance, class, and static methods

- **Inheritance**
  - Single inheritance
  - Overriding methods
  - Using `super()` to call parent methods
  - Real-world examples

- **Polymorphism**
  - Compile-time (method overloading, operator overloading)
  - Runtime (method overriding)
  - Duck typing examples

- **Encapsulation**
  - Concept and motivation
  - Example code
